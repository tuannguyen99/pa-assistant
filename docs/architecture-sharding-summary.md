# Architecture Sharding Complete 

## Summary

Successfully sharded the massive architecture.md (12,255 lines) into 35 focused, manageable files.

## What Was Created

**Location:** \docs/architecture/\

### Core Files (36 total)
- **index.md** - Main table of contents with links to all sections
- **35 section files** - Each covering a specific architectural area

### Key Benefits

1. **Better Navigation** - Jump directly to relevant sections
2. **Faster Loading** - Average ~350 lines per file vs 12,000+ lines
3. **Easier Editing** - Focus on one area without scrolling through entire document
4. **Better Git Diffs** - Changes show up in specific files, not one giant diff
5. **Collaborative Editing** - Multiple team members can edit different sections simultaneously
6. **Clearer Organization** - Logical separation of concerns
