- `docs/PRD.md` — Product Requirements Document (detailed requirements)
- `docs/README.md` — Short index and role behaviour summary

Role behaviour note (short):
- A user account can have multiple roles (Employee, Manager, HR Admin). The system supports role switching with contextual UI indicators and audit logging. Reviewers are scoped by manager→direct-report relationships; HR Admins have elevated visibility and auditable privileges.
